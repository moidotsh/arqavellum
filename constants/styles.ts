//     from theme.brand at runtime — no hardcoded hex).
//   - SPACING (duplicates theme.spacing; use useAppTheme().spacing).

/**
 * The screen-body centered-column constraint. Every full-screen route's
 * body container (ScrollView, FlatList, or outermost View) applies this
 * via `[SCREEN_BODY_STYLE, ...]` or `...SCREEN_BODY_STYLE` in its body
 * StyleSheet entry.
 *
 * Why a constant and not a wrapper primitive: the body is one of three
 * shapes (ScrollView / FlatList / View) and each carries screen-specific
 * contentContainerStyle / keyboard handling / ref / onScroll props. A
 * wrapper would need 80% of those props to earn its keep. A constant is
 * the minimum surface that enforces the constraint identically across
 * every consumer.
 *
 * Enforced by scripts/audit-screen-body.ts (SB1) — every app/*.tsx
 * screen must reference SCREEN_BODY_STYLE. The audit exists because the
 * per-screen inline approach silently drifted (5 screens lost the
 * constraint between QA1 and QA2); the audit prevents the next drift.
 *
 * Mobile-only. The 420pt column is the right shape for a mobile-first
 * PWA on any viewport (mobile-shaped, with whitespace on the sides at
 * desktop widths). If a consumer later wants true tablet/desktop
 * layouts (multi-column dashboards, sidebar nav, persistent rails),
 * the right move is to add a sibling `DesktopPremium` kit with its
 * own body constant — NOT to parameterize this one. The MobilePremium
 * primitives are tuned for mobile constraints (490px height budget,
 * safe-area insets, touch targets); reusing them at desktop widths
 * would require retuning each one. See docs/contributing.md →
 * "Adding desktop support" for the evolution path.
